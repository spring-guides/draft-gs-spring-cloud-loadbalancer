This guide walks you through the process of creating load-balanced microservices.

== What you'll build

You'll build a microservice application that uses Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to provide 
client-side load-balancing in calls to another microservice.

== Implement "Say Hello" service

Our "server" service is called "Say Hello".
It will return a random greeting (picked out of a static list of three) from an endpoint accessible at `/greeting`.

In `src/main/java/hello`, create the file `SayHelloApplication.java`. It should look like this:

`say-hello/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloApplication.java`

[source,java]
----
include::complete/say-hello/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloApplication.java[]
----

It's a simple `@RestController`, where we have one `@RequestMapping method` for `/greeting` and then another for the root path `/`.

We’re going to run multiple instances of this application locally alongside a client service application, so create the directory `src/main/resources`, create the file `application.yml` within it, and then, in that file, set a default value for server.port.
(We’ll instruct the other instances of the application to run on other ports, as well, so that none of the `Say Hello` instances will conflict with the client when we get that running).
While we’re in this file, we’ll set the `spring.application.name` for our service too.

`say-hello/src/main/resources/application.yml`

[source,java]
----
include::complete/say-hello/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

== Access from a client service

The "User" application will be what our user sees.
It will make a call to the Say Hello application to get a greeting and then send that to our user when the user visits the endpoints at `/hi` and `/hello`.

In the User application directory, under `src/main/java/hello`, add the file `UserApplication.java`:

`user/src/main/java/hello/UserApplication.java`

[source,java]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/java/hello/UserApplication.java[]
----

We also add a `@Configuration` class where we will set up a load-balanced `WebClient.Builder` instance:

`user/src/main/java/hello/WebClientConfig.java`

[source,java]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/java/hello/WebClientConfig.java[]
----

The configuration provides a `@LoadBalanced WebClient.Builder` instance, that we use when someone hits the `hi` endpoint of
`UserApplication.java`.
Once the `hi` endpoint is hit, we will use this builder to create a `WebClient` instance which will be used to make an HTTP `GET` request to the Say Hello service's URL and give us the result as a `String`.

In `UserApplication.java`, we have also added a `/hello` endpoint that does the same action underneath, however, rather than using the `@LoadBalanced` annotation, we make use of an `@Autowired` load-balancer exchange filter function `lbFunction` that we pass using the `filter()` method to a `WebClient` instance that we are building programmatically.

TIP: Even though we set up the load-balanced `WebClient` instance slightly differently for the two endpoints, the end behaviour for both is exactly the same.
Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is used underneath to select an appropriate instance of the "Say Hello" service.

Add the `spring.application.name` and `server.port` properties to `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

`user/src/main/resources/application.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

== Load-balance across server instances

Now we can access `/hi` or `hello` on the User service and see a friendly greeting:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8888/hi
Greetings, Mary!

$ curl http://localhost:8888/hi?name=Orontes
Salutations, Orontes!
----

As you will see, in `WebClientConfig.java`, we pass a custom configuration for the LoadBalancer using the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation:

`@LoadBalancerClient(name = "say-hello", configuration = SayHelloConfiguration.class)`.
This means that whenever a service named `say-hello` is being contacted, instead of running with the default setup, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer will use the configuration provided in `SayHelloConfiguration.java`:

`user/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloConfiguration.java`

[source,java]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/java/hello/SayHelloConfiguration.java[]
----

There, we provide a custom `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` with 3 hard-coded instances that Spring Cloud LoadBalancer will choose from while making the calls to the "Say Hello" service.

NOTE: This step has been added to explain how you can pass your own custom configuration to the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
However, you don't need to use the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation and create your own configuration for the LoadBalancer.
The most typical way, is to use Spring Cloud LoadBalancer with service discovery.
If you have any `DiscoveryClient` on your classpath, the default Spring Cloud LoadBalancer configuration will use it under the hood to check for service instances. Like this, you will also only choose from instances that are up and running.
You can learn how to use `ServiceDiscovery` with this https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/[guide].

We also add an `application.yml` file with default `server.port` and `spring.application.name`:

`user/src/main/resources/application.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/user/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

== Trying it out

Run the Say Hello service, using either Gradle:

----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

or Maven:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

Run other instances on ports 9092 and 9999, again using either Gradle:

----
$ SERVER_PORT=9092 ./gradlew bootRun
----

or Maven:

----
$ SERVER_PORT=9999 mvn spring-boot:run
----

Then start up the User service.
Access `localhost:8888/hi` and then watch the Say Hello service instances.

And your requests to the User service should result in calls to Say Hello being spread across the running instances in round-robin form:

----
2016-03-09 21:15:28.915  INFO 90046 --- [nio-8090-exec-7] hello.SayHelloApplication                : Access /greeting
----


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it.


== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring application!
